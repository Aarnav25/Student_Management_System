A **Student Management System Website** is a platform designed to manage and display students' academic data effectively. It allows users to input details such as student names and their marks in various subjects, which are then used to generate a table summarizing all the students' performance. The table provides a consolidated view of student marks, streamlining the process of academic record-keeping.

 Key Features:
1. User Input: Users can enter student information and their marks through a simple web interface.
2. Marks Table Generation: The system processes the input and creates a table that shows the marks for each subject.

This system aims to simplify academic record management by providing an easy and organized way to view student performance without calculating averages.
